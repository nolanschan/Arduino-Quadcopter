# Self-Stabilizing Quadcopter using Arduino #



## About ##

This is the Aruduino flight controller code for the quadcopter my group built for our senior capstone design class.

More details about our project can be found on my Github.io site <a href="https://nolanschan.github.io/projects/quadcopter/">here</a>.



## Reference/Credit ##

This code is a fork/rewrite of the <a href="http://www.brokking.net/ymfc-al_main.html">Project YMFC-AL flight controller</a> by Joop Brokking.



## Modifications ##

-  I rewrote the code to ensure that I fully understood it.
-  I elected not to use the EEPROM for data storage.
-  Some minor structural changes were made to the original code.
